# The Problem StockDreams Solves

Sourcing and creating visual content has traditionally been very time and cost prohibitive for most businesses and individuals.
Finding the perfect image for your website or ad can mean endlessly searching stock photo sites at inflated costs. Even budget sites charge up to $100 per image — which adds up fast.
Producing custom graphics or illustrations from scratch requires expensive graphic design software subscriptions and specialized artistic skill sets.

StockDreams set out to solve these challenges by tapping into the rapid advances in AI image generation technology over recent years.
Powerful machine learning algorithms can now generate incredibly realistic and diverse images. But most existing services are complex with high monthly costs or quotas.
StockDreams makes AI visual content creation simple, unlimited, and affordable.
